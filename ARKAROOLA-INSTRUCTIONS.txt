1. Power on the laptop using the power button.  
   It can take upto 5 minutes to boot.  
   You should see a strip of icons down the left of the external monitor.
   If you instead see a login prompt, the username and password are both arkaroola.
2. When you can see the desktop with the icons down the left, there should also be
   an icon on the desktop called seismo.  Double click that to start.

You should not need to do anything else, and the seismo display should start.
There is a bit of a blink each time it updates, which should be once per second.

If you want to save a copy of the current display, a PNG image file gets written
once per minute to /tmp/seismo.png. You can insert a USB memory stick and use the
file manager to copy this.

If the computer freezes, you may need to hold the power button until the power light goes
off, and then start the instructions from the top again.
